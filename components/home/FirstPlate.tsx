            <br/>First Plate was inspired by the idea that food can bring people together. Many people struggle with finding the perfect restaurant for a first date, which can cause stress and anxiety. By matching users with restaurants, First Plate eliminates the guesswork and allows users to focus on connecting with their potential partner over a shared culinary experience. In addition, food is a topic that many people are passionate about, so a food-based dating app can help users form deeper connections and potentially find a long-lasting relationship. After all- the stomach is the way to the heart.

          We feel extremely proud of having coded First Plate as React Native beginners. Building this app meant learning a new programming language, developing a deep understanding of software development principles, and having a clear understanding of what the app is intended to do. We were able to translate an initial Figma design into a React Native app, creating a user-friendly, colorful, and bright interface. Beyond the frontend design, we learned how to create a login and sign-up page, securely connected to the Supabase backend, and integrated the Checkbook API for the "pay it forward" feature. Both of these features were also new to our team. Along the way, we encountered many React Native bugs, which were challenging and time-consuming to debug as a beginner team. We implemented front-end design features such as scroll view, flexbox, tab and stack navigation, a unique animation transition, and linking pages using a navigator, to create a seamless and intuitive user experience in our app. We are proud of our teamwork, determination, and hard work that culminated in a successful project.
